# Polynomial-Regression
## Building Bluff detector using Polynomial Regression in R programming

Business scenario.

Human Resources team is about to hire a new employee in the company. 
During the salary negotiation process, a potential employee candidate tells he has 20+ years of experience and earned 160,000 
annual salary in his previous company. Therefore, he is asking now for at least more than 160,000. One of the HRs decides to check 
this info. To do this he has the only data set about ten different positions and salaries in the candidateâ€™s previous company. You, 
as a data scientist helping HR, have to build a regression model and to predict if this new candidate employee is bluffing about his 
salary or not. You have to build this bluffing detector by using a polynomial regression for the Position_Salaries.csv file. 
Explore different polynomial features and degrees of the polynomial, choose the best model and support your decision with numbers 
and/or graphs. For your final model report the coefficients, intercept, R2, and plot a graph with data points and the regression line. 
Before building a model, you might want to do data preprocessing. But do not split this data into training and test sets.
